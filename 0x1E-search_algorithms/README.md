-<-- Search Algorithms -->-
Search Algorithm are functions used to locate a particular element in a data
structure such as an array or linked list

They can be linear, or binary.
The extra amount of temporary space need to depend on the implemtation of the 
algorithm
Some need one (o(1)) some need space equal to the size of the data structure
