Static and Dynamic labraries are collections of object files
how they are linked during linking stage of compilation is what differentiates
the two

Statically linked files are added but are not used during runtime since it is
the object file of the program that will be run

In shared libraries (also called dynamic libraries, it is not the object files
that are added but copies.

Static libraries are disadvantageous when space is considered since, as the number of files to be compiled grows so does the amount of space consumed. Dynamic libraries in comparison consume much less.
